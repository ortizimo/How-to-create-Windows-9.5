INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------
Windows 9 doesn’t exist…or does it? Well it does, but only as an unofficial custom embedded OS for new ATMs, Digital Signage
systems and Point-of-Sales systems just like the old Windows RT was. Windows 9 is actually a Windows 8.1 Industry Pro version,
but without all the tracking and telemetry, and other useless services. It also has a ton of tweaks to make it look and feel like
Windows 7 for those industries and users.

None of us regular mortals will ever see this cool and light-weight OS for home use, but you can make one using you own Windows 8.1
or even Windows 10 copy. Today I will walk you on how to create your own Windows 9…err Windows 9.5 copy.

For it, I’ll be using Windows 8.1 Pro N to create the Windows 9.5 version. Pro N basically comes without Windows Media Player and
related technologies installed. Why 9.5? Glad you asked. The differences between the real 9 and our 9.5 version are significant for
our purposes, for starters, you cannot truly game on the actual Windows 9. This version is streamed-line for industry operations so
why have support for gaming in it right?! But the most important reason is that Windows 9 works on specific hardware and you cannot
just buy any motherboard or video card and expect it to work like it should. Building it using Windows 8.1 will be the best choice
because we’ll still have native support for USB 3.0, DirectX12 support, better memory management, DISM Recovery Tools, Secure-boot,
SMB3.0, New File-copy dialog, and as already stated, support for out-of-the-shelf motherboards and other hardware.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: You can do these steps using a blank HDD or using a VM, and then later you can create an image of the VM from it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
-----------------------------------------
• A copy of Windows 8.1 Pro or Pro N
	o updated to the latest patch (optional)
• Oracle Virtualbox 5.0 or above or VMware Workstation 12 or above
	o 8GB ram or better
	o 500GB HDD or better

STEP #1: INITIAL SETUP
-----------------------------------------
1. Start from a fresh install of Windows either using another computer or a different HDD
	a. Make sure you customize the setup and turn everything OFF
	b. Enter a fake email and password when asked to create an account unless you have an account

2. Update your OS to the latest patches…this may take a while!

3. Delete and Unpin all panels from the Start Screen except for the Desktop and Internet Explorer
	a. Search for and pin to the Start screen the following:
		i. Control Panel
		ii. Regedit
		iii. Cmd prompt

4. Use Internet Explorer and download either Chrome or Firefox

5. (Optional) Uninstall Internet Explorer from the Start screen
	a. With the Internet Explorer shortcut you’ll have to uncheck the box on the Windows Features pop-up screen

6. Also while you’re there, uncheck anything that reads:

8. Log back in and unpin the Internet Explorer icon in the Start screen and also the Taskbar


STEP #2: STREAMLINING
-----------------------------------------
1. Go to Control Panel and change the view to “Large Icons”

2. (Optional) I recommend having all the latest security patches and updates available for our Windows 9.5 project, then, coming
in and start disabling what we don’t need, but if you don’t have a more-than-legit copy of Windows and you don’t want to update it
then do the optional steps below. This will mean that any updates required for gaming will need to be downloaded and installed manually.

3. (Optional) Go to Control Panel > Windows Update > Change Settings
	a. Select “Never check for updates” from the drop-down menu
	b. Uncheck the two boxes below
	c. Click OK

4.	Go to Action Center:

c.	(Optional) While you’re there click on Change report settings and select “Never check for solutions”
d.	Go to Customer Experience Improvement Program setting and select “No, I don’t want to participate in the program”…this may already
	be grayed out
e.	Now Uncheck which messages to turn off then click OK
f.	If you want to raise the warning when any software tries to installs itself and make changes to your computer then raise the bar
	here then click OK
g.	Go to Change Windows SmartScreen and set it to “Get admin approval”
h.	Click OK


STEP #3: SHUT-DOWN SERVICES
